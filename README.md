In this lab, we completed 3 excercises to display the uses of functions and conditionals in p5/Javascript.

The first excercise involved creating any sort of abstract shape using a collection of p5js's shapes. Additionally, there must be conditionals that affect
the shape in some way, such as changing the color os size depending on mouse position/state.        https://editor.p5js.org/connorL/sketches/xfb9qVSsG

In the second exercise, the shape and the conditionals attached to it needed to be moved into a function. I moved the abstract shape into one function,
and the conditionals into another.

In the third exercise, the functions must be given aparameters that change what happens in the function, such as being able to change the scale 
of the shape, or change the color based on function parameters. I made the shape constantly grow at a slow rate, and changed the color based on granular mouse position.
